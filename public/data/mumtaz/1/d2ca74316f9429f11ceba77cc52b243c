We need to have a single MEIF Debian package which contains the agents for all the different supported clouds. Or possibly multiple Debian packages each for a different cloud (less preferred).\r\n * We are considering adding Docker packaging support to MEIF and providing pre-built docker images to the user, for both stand-alone MEIF and MEIF deployed as an Azure IoT Edge Module. These Docker images also require building a monolithic MEIF with support for all or multiple clouds instead of one Docker image per cloud.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect covered in this MR is that the MEIF agent application and any other services\/daemons\/docker-containers of MEIF which are once deployed should automatically be restarted on a device reboot. The user should not be required to restart any service manually.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Nucleus QA has also requested the feature to build multiple clouds in one go:\r\n\r\nMEIF-434: Building MEIF for multiple cloud platforms simultaneously\r\n\r\nOne question needs to be clarified in relation to this feature. When multiple cloud platforms are being simultaneously built, then will we just build their individual demo applications or will we support a single combined demo for all cloud platforms? If multiple demos will be built, then this feature may not align well with the current workflow of importing the CMake project into CodeBench and debugging it there, as multiple demos are associated with a single project.","issuelinks":[{"id":"211413","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issueLink\/211413","type":{"id":"10130","name":"Implements","inward":"implements","outward":"implemented by","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issueLinkType\/10130"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"235661","key":"MEIF-1829","self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issue\/235661","fields":{"summary":"Revisit MEIF packaging","status":{"self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/status\/1","description":"The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.","iconUrl":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/images\/icons\/statuses\/open.png","name":"Open","id":"1","statusCategory":{"self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/statuscategory\/2","id":2,"key":"new","colorName":"blue-gray","name":"To Do"}},"priority":{"self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/priority\/3","iconUrl":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/images\/icons\/priorities\/major.svg","name":"Major","id":"3"},"issuetype":{"self":"http:\/\/jira.alm.mentorg.com:8080\/rest\/api\/2\/issuetype\/6","id":"6","description":"Created by JIRA Software - do not edit or delete.
